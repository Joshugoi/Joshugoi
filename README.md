<h2>üñ•Ô∏è CyberSecurity Projects:</h2>

  - <b>[SOAR EDR](https://github.com/Joshugoi/SOAR-EDR)</b>
    - In this project, I created a SOAR and EDR solution with tools like LimaCharlie(agent & cloud-based sec platform), Tines, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and Elastic EDR. This project demonstrates how to automate security workflows, enhance threat detection, and optimize cybersecurity posture effectively. By integrating these tools, I enhanced threat mitigation strategies, provided real-time security insights, and streamlined the efficiency of security operations.

<h2>‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Projects:</h2>

  - <b> Rapid Document Conversion </b>
    - The goal is to create an AWS Lambda app for quick and accurate document conversion, such as HTML to PDF or Excel to Word. It enables content retrieval, formatting, and conversion for download or display. This app is ideal for job portals where users must convert resumes into various formats.
      
  - <b> Mass Emailing using AWS Lambda </b>
    - This project aims to send mass emails to a firm's customers. Using AWS Lambda with Simple Email Service (SES) and S3, you can create a cost-effective mass-mailing platform similar to MoonMail.
  
  - <b> Windows Virtual Machine ‚Äì Deployment  </b>
    - The goal is to deploy a Windows Virtual Machine with no violations securely. Amazon Lightsail simplifies VM deployment on AWS, offering an easy-to-use interface and resource optimization. It supports RDP client connections for seamless management.
  
  - <b> Website Development using AWS </b>
    - The goal is to develop a secure, reliable, user-friendly AWS website. AWS Lightsail, paired with EC2 or Lambda, offers SSD-based storage and pre-configured web development options. Applications include student management or expense tracking.
      
  - <b> Serverless Web App </b>
    - The goal is to develop and deploy a secure serverless web app using AWS services like Amplify, Lambda, and Cognito. Amplify handles the front-end and hosting, Cognito manages authentication, DynamoDB provides storage, and Lambda with API Gateway powers the backend. Start with a simple app, such as an MI calculator, using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and RESTful APIs.

  - <b> Real-time Data Processing Application </b>
    - The goal is to process high-volume data accurately in real-time. Using Amazon Kinesis Stream and AWS Lambda, create a stream to capture data from web sources. Lambda functions scale automatically with the stream. Data sources can include social media timelines or location-based data.

  - <b> Customer Logic Workflow </b>
    - The goal is to design and deploy custom logic workflows triggered by events using AWS Lambda and SNS. Step Functions enable easy integration of Lambdas into workflows. This beginner-friendly project can be applied to shopping cart management, leveraging data from e-commerce sites for testing and validation.
